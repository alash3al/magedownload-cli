# Usage

See the help command for all command information:

    $ php magedownload.phar help

## Configuration

To use the Magento download API you must have a user ID and token.  These can be generated by logging into your account on [magento.com](https://magento.com/) and navigating to **Account Settings** -> **Downloads Access Token**.

Once you have your credentials, you can either specify them with each command (using `--id` and `--token` options), or use the `configure` command to save the settings to your environment (in `~/.magedownload/config.yaml`).

See `php magedownload.phar help configure` for details.

## Commands

### `download`

    $ php magedownload.phar download [<name>] [<destination>] [--extract]

or

    $ php n98-magerun.phar download:download [<name>] [<destination>] [--extract]

Downloads the specified file to the given destination.  Use the `files` command to find the correct `<name>`.

If no name is given, you will be prompted to select a file to download.

If no destination is given, the file is downloaded to current directory.

When `--extract` is given, the downloaded file will be extracted when possible.  The destination must end with `.zip`, `.tar.bz2`, or `.tar.gz`.  The files will be extracted to a folder of the same name, without the file extension.

### `files`

    $ php magedownload.phar files

or

    $ php n98-magerun.phar download:files

Lists files that are available for download.

You may use either `--filter-version` or `--filter-type` options to narrow your search.  Examples:

* `php magedownload.phar files --filter-version 1.9.2.2`
* `php magedownload.phar files --filter-version "1.9.*"`
* `php magedownload.phar files --filter-type ce-full`

_* Due to limitiations with the API, only one filter may be used at a time._


### `versions`

    $ php magedownload.phar versions

or

    $ php n98-magerun.phar download:versions

Lists all Magento versions that have been released.
